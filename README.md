# CardWars_Project

The idea with this project is to try and make a version of the game "Card Wars" from the cartoon network show Adventure Time, using Augmented Reality.
REMINDER:
This project is just a prototype and is in no way affiliated with Cartoon Network or the creators of the original show.
